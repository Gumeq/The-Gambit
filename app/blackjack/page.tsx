        <p className="text-base font-medium">
          Blackjack is one of the most popular online casino games offered at
          SpinVibe.com. The objective of Blackjack is to get a hand as close to
          21 as possible, beating the dealer in the process. Winning with a
          standard hand pays 1:1, while winning with a Blackjack (an Ace plus a
          10 or face card) pays 3:2.

          How to Play Blackjack Online at SpinVibe
        </h2>
        <p className="text-base font-medium">
          Playing Blackjack and other table games at SpinVibe.com is simple.
          Start by creating an account and depositing your preferred currency or
          cryptocurrency.
        </p>
        <p className="text-base font-medium">
          Once seated at a Blackjack table, you&apos;ll place your bets and
          decide whether to &quot;stand&quot; (keep your current cards) or
          &quot;hit&quot; (receive another card). You can stand with any hand
          valued at 21 or less, but the key is balancing riskâ€”hit too often, and
          you may bust, exceeding 21.
        </p>
        <p className="text-base font-medium">
          Knowing when to hit or stand is essential for your Blackjack strategy
          and can help you win more often against the dealer.
        </p>

        <h2 className="mt-4 text-xl font-bold">Basic Rules of Blackjack</h2>
        <p className="text-base font-medium">
          While Blackjack revolves around aiming for 21, there are a few
          additional rules to keep in mind:
        </p>
        <ul className="ml-6 list-disc text-base font-medium">
          <li>
            <strong>Hit or Stand:</strong> With each hand, you must choose
            whether to hit or stand.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Split:</strong> If your first two cards form a pair (e.g.,
            two 5s), you can choose to split them into two separate hands. To
            split, you must place an additional bet equal to your original
            wager.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Double Down:</strong> This option allows you to double your
            bet in exchange for just one more card. Though risky, it can
            increase your potential payout if you&apos;re confident about your
            hand.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Insurance:</strong> If the dealer&apos;s face-up card is an
            Ace, you can place an insurance bet, betting that the dealer will
            hit Blackjack. If correct, you win 2:1 on your insurance bet.
          </li>
        </ul>

          Blackjack Betting Options & Bet Sizes
        </h2>
        <p className="text-base font-medium">
          After adding funds to your SpinVibe account, you can select your
          desired bet size for each hand. Since standard Blackjack hands pay out
          1:1, your stake determines the amount you can win.
        </p>

        <h2 className="mt-4 text-xl font-bold">
          Blackjack Payouts & House Edge
        </h2>
        <p className="text-base font-medium">
          Our Blackjack games feature one of the industry&apos;s lowest house
          edges at 0.57%, meaning the theoretical return to player (RTP) is
          99.43%. For payouts, standard hands that beat the dealer pay 1:1,
          while Blackjack pays 3:2. Insurance bets pay out 2:1.
        </p>

        <h2 className="mt-4 text-xl font-bold">Blackjack Strategies & Tips</h2>
        <p className="text-base font-medium">
          While luck influences every hand, having a basic strategy is key to
          playing Blackjack effectively. Here are some helpful tips:
        </p>
        <ul className="ml-6 list-disc text-base font-medium">
          <li>
            It&apos;s smart to stand on a hand of 17 or higher, as going bust
            will guarantee a loss.
          </li>
          <li>
            Always evaluate the dealer&apos;s visible card before deciding your
            next move. If the dealer shows a card between 7 and Ace, they likely
            have a strong hand, which should influence your play.
          </li>
          <li>
            Aces and 8s are good pairs to split since they increase your chances
            of drawing a 10 on the next card.
          </li>
          <li>
            After doubling down, you&apos;re only dealt one more card, so make
            sure it&apos;s a good situation to use this option.
          </li>
        </ul>
